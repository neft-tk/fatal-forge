## Description <a name="description"></a>
GridLocke is a tactical card game using React.js. The game is about controlling space on a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grid by playing cards that are stronger than your opponents. You are able to casecade and chain multiple cards together, allowing for  a level of depth in gameplay. Users are given a premade deck on account creation, and are also able to create and edit decks as they go. There is a friend system where you can check what accounts exist and add them to your list of friends.
